## How to run this Theme
This project uses the cross-platform [just](https://github.com/casey/just) taskrunner. 

It can be built/installed [all the usual ways](https://github.com/casey/just#installation), or downloaded straight from the [latest release](https://github.com/casey/just/releases).

Once you've got it, open the terminal:

```bash
# Work from the project root.
cd /path/to/this/place

# To automatically rebuild the project when source files are changed,
# run this (then CTRL+C to exit):
just watch

# To rebuild the project manually, run:
just build
```

## Happy Coding!!!
